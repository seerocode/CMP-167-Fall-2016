# CMP-167-Fall-2016

Welcome! This is a repo specifically for Java projects made in Programming Methods I class at Lehman College. 

##The organization is as follows (and may change):
* Projects begin with "Project-" and the number of the project
* Homework assignments are given titles based on what the program does 

I may or may not separate this into Homework and Projects folder. We'll see.
