#Guess My Number
This program is written in Java and is part of a homework assignment with some extra credit I threw in voluntarily. :)
The task was to write a program that asks the user for input (a nunber guess) and using the Random class, returns a random number as the computer's guess. The user's guess, computer's guess, and the difference between the two is output to the user.
I thought this was the perfect opportunity to learn how to do a loop to iterate each time the user made an incorrect guess. I did so with an if/else if statement in a do/while loop so only when the user guesses correctly will the program stop. 

Also, I did not use format strings in the if/else if statement because it would have been too many strings on the same line. I used println() instead and some \n escapes to get to new lines. The code works perfectly and looks great too.

(P.S. The comments are mostly for myself so I can remember why I did what I did. This many comments is not necessary in production environments.)
